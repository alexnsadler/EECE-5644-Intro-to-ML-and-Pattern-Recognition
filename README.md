# EECE 5644: Introduction to Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition (Spring 2019)

### Course Objectives: 
Machine learning is the study and design of algorithms that enables
computers/machines to learn from experience/data. This course is an introductory course on
machine learning covering a range of algorithms, focusing on the underlying models behind each
approach, to enable students to learn where and how to apply machine learning algorithms and
why they work. The course also emphasizes on the foundations to prepare students for research
in machine learning. The subjects covered include: Bayes decision theory, maximum likelihood
parameter estimation, model selection, mixture density estimation, probabilistic graphical
models, support vector machines, neural networks, decision trees, feature selection and
dimensionality reduction, ensemble methods: boosting and bagging.
